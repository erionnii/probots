                        <p>most famous robot companies are: Tesla, Boston Dynamics, Android, Skydio, SEEGRID etc. Each
                            of them have very special plan for future and make better robots to do our life easier and

                        <p>Technology though is being created by humanity is more accurate than human. The fact which
                            confirm this opinion is different machines which make any big product like cars, airplane
                            etc.</p>
                        <h1>High quality and precisior services</h1>
                        <p>Robot do very good work beacuse do the precisior work which a human can't do it without
                            technology or any robot. We can see different forms of metal or very precisior cuts of any
                            material which are worked from robots.</p>

                            Beacuse hard works would finish by robots. And this time is not far beacuse technology is
                            developing every day. So in ROBOTS ERA physical work at human would not exist more.</p>

                            <p>As see also in photos robots can do different works like cleaning, accurate cutting of
                                the material, make vehicles, customer services etc. So robots can offer you very much
                                profits by using them. All these services robots can do if they are programmed by humans
                                to do them. Hold on ROBOTS ERA is coming and is more near than never. Human lifes would
                                change for 180 degrees for good.</p>

                            humans. These robots can climb, can walk to stairs and other movements like humans and thei
                            name is humanoids. This robot can recognize the face of a select group of individuals, can
                            also register stationary objects and other services which helped this robot to be most
                            advanced robot in the world </p>

                        <p>The robotics industry is expected to grow significantly over the coming years. Estimates
                            suggest that the sector could be worth as much as $260 billion by 2030. Much of this growth
                            will come from professional services robots that perform useful tasks for humans, such as
                            cleaning, delivering, and transporting.</p>

                            <p>Next good feature of robots is sense perception. This feature gives the robot the human name beacuse the touch, vision, taste, hearing and smell are being implenetd at robots. Every day programmers are working to make more same with humans </p>
